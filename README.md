# Abadi

**Liquidity for DreamDEX Event Contracts.**

*Abadi* is Indonesian for **everlasting** — the markets expire every window, the
liquidity does not.

Built for the Somnia × DreamDEX Event Contracts Hackathon.

## What it is

A market-making vault that quotes both sides of DreamDEX Event Contract markets with
**zero inventory**, and captures the spread with **no directional exposure**.

Depositors put in collateral and receive ERC-4626 shares. An operator key steers quotes
and can never touch the money. Every filled pair is worth exactly 1 at settlement no
matter which way the market resolves.

## Why quoting, and not predicting

We did not pick this from a whiteboard. We measured it.

**2,422 settled markets, pulled from the indexer:**

| Tier | n | UP won | z vs a fair coin |
|---|---|---|---|
| 60s | 500 | 49.6% | −0.18 |
| 300s | 500 | 48.6% | −0.63 |
| 900s | 500 | 48.2% | −0.80 |
| 1h | 500 | 51.0% | +0.45 |
| 4h | 364 | 51.9% | +0.73 |
| 24h | 58 | 58.6% | +1.31 |
| **pooled** | **2422** | **49.96%** | **−0.04** |

Outcomes are indistinguishable from a coin flip. Meanwhile the venue quotes a flat
**2.9% spread** on every market and every tier.

With a coin flip and a 2.9% spread, the arithmetic is not ambiguous:

```
taker (crosses the spread)   -1.45% per contract
maker (collects the spread)  +1.45% per fill
```

Our original design had a directional vault **taking** liquidity each window. On the
900-second tier at 10% deployment that is:

```
after 1 day  ( 96 rolls)  ->  87.0% of deposit
after 7 days (672 rolls)  ->  37.7%
```

Zero fees do not save it — the spread is the cost. **We cut that product on the evidence
and built the other side of the trade instead.** Full working in

## The mechanism

DreamDEX keeps **one** order book. A Buy YES crossing a Buy NO needs no seller at all —
the pool mints a fresh YES/NO pair from the two buyers' combined collateral.

That is what makes zero inventory possible:

```
BUY_YES @ p         escrows  p          per contract
BUY_NO  @ p + s     escrows  1-(p+s)    per contract   (price is always YES-side)
                             -------
pair cost                    1 - s
```

Both legs fill → the vault holds a complete set, worth exactly **1** at settlement
whichever side wins. The spread `s` is captured with **zero** directional exposure, and
no inventory was needed up front.

Verified on chain: 100 contracts a side escrowed **97.40 tUSDC**, not 100.

### Custody

BinaryPool has no operator gate — the DreamDEX team confirmed that the only shape that
works today is a contract that owns its own orders. That is exactly what Abadi is.

| Actor | Can | Cannot |
|---|---|---|
| `operator` (bot key) | quote, cancel | **move a single token** |
| `governor` | set operator, risk params, grid | touch assets |
| depositor | deposit, withdraw against shares | steer quotes |

## What is live

First quote on Shannon, `ETH-0-27AUG26/tUSDC`:

```
theirs : 0.742 / 0.772    spread 0.030
ours   : 0.744 / 0.770    spread 0.026   <- inside
```

Read back off the live book:

```
       BIDS                   ASKS
  0.744  x 100  <- Abadi      0.769  x 200
  0.742  x 200                0.770  x 100  <- Abadi
  0.733  x 330                0.779  x 330
```

Abadi's bid became the **best bid on the market**, and the spread went from **0.030 to
0.025** — the incumbent quoter tightened in response.

That is the ecosystem-impact claim demonstrated instead of asserted: one vault quoting
inside made prices better for everyone else trading that market.

### Then both legs filled

ETH moved, the market's implied probability fell from about 0.75 to 0.50, and both of our
resting legs were taken. On-chain holdings:

```
paid at quote time         97.40 tUSDC
holds                      100 up  +  100 down     <- a complete set
worth at settlement        100.00 tUSDC            <- whichever side wins
                          ----------------
locked in                   +2.60 tUSDC  ·  2.67%
directional exposure         0.00
```

Both legs were **buys**. Neither could have filled against a seller, because no seller
was involved — they crossed each other through the mint-a-pair path and the pool minted
the pair. That is why the position cost 97.40 rather than 100, and why it needed no
inventory to begin with.

Zero-inventory two-sided quoting is not a design claim any more. It happened.

**One fill is not a track record.** It proves the mechanism; it says nothing yet about
fill frequency or adverse selection, which is the real risk a maker carries. Measuring
that needs many quotes over many windows.

## Architecture

```
src/
  MarketEngine.sol        pure grid math — every SDK sharp edge paid for once
  LiquidityVault.sol      ERC-4626 vault, zero-inventory two-sided quoting
  AbadiReactive.sol       keeper-free wake-up via the reactivity precompile
  interfaces/
    IBinaryPool.sol            placeBinaryOrder, ORDER_KIND, ERC-6909 outcomes
    IBinaryMarketsModule.sol   markets(), mint/merge, redeem, keeper entries

scripts/                  read-only probes that produced docs/evidence/
  probe.ts                live markets, tiers, spreads
  history.ts              settled-market calibration
  operator.ts             reads the book and quotes inside it, in one pass
  verify.ts               reads our own orders back off the book
```

### Lifecycle

```
quote ──► fill ──┬──► flatten ──► collateral back immediately
                 └──► settle  ──► redeem after resolution
```

**`settle()` is permissionless.** Proceeds go to the vault, never the caller, so there is
nothing to steal — and a settled market leaves the live list entirely, so nothing
upstream will remind the vault the position exists. Redemption has to be pulled, and
gating it behind a key is how capital gets stranded when that key goes quiet.

**`flatten()` merges complete sets back to collateral without waiting.** A complete set is
worth exactly 1 at any moment, so leaving it idle until the window resolves wastes the
capital.

Its access is split rather than open, deliberately. Cancelling a live quote throws away
the spread the vault exists to earn, so a fully open `flatten` would let anyone grief the
vault by closing good quotes on repeat. The operator may flatten whenever it judges a
quote dead; **anyone** may flatten once the market can no longer trade, because past that
point no fill is possible and capital must not sit behind a key that has gone quiet.

An uneven fill leaves a single-side leg that cannot be merged and still carries
direction — `flatten` merges what it can and leaves the slot open for `settle()`.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std   # forge-std is not vendored
forge test                 # 51 tests, no network needed

node scripts/probe.ts      # live markets and spreads
node scripts/history.ts    # settled-market calibration
node scripts/operator.ts   # read the book and quote inside it  (needs .env)
node scripts/verify.ts     # read our orders back off the book
```

`.env` needs `PRIVATE_KEY` for anything that writes. Deploy:

```bash
forge create src/LiquidityVault.sol:LiquidityVault \
  --constructor-args $COLLATERAL $MODULE $OUTCOME_TOKEN $GOVERNOR 1000 1000
```

`1000 / 1000` are the tick and lot grids: `precision.price = 3` on this venue, which is
`0.001` at the collateral's 6 decimals.

## Honest status

**Working and verified on testnet**

- Vault deployed, funded, quoting live, sitting at the top of book
- Zero-inventory pair economics confirmed on chain (97.40 for 100 a side)
- 51 tests passing, including two fuzzed invariants

- **Both legs filled**, into a complete set, with the spread locked in and zero
  directional exposure

**Built and tested, not yet exercised on chain**

- `settle()` — redemption after resolution, including the void path where **both** sides
  pay 0.5 and redeeming only the "winner" would abandon half the position
- `flatten()` — early merge of complete sets back to collateral

**Blocked, and honestly so**

- `AbadiReactive` — keeper-free self-rearming rolls. The mechanism is understood and
  built against the official `@somnia-chain/reactivity-contracts` base, but a handler
  must hold **32 STT** and our testnet allowance is spent. Not a code problem; a faucet
  problem. See
  [`docs/evidence/reactivity-spike-2026-08-26.md`](docs/evidence/reactivity-spike-2026-08-26.md).

Until that lands, rolls fall back to permissionless bounty triggers using the venue's own
keeper entries (`finalizeMarket`, `releasePool`, `pokeOracle`). Still trustless and
non-custodial — the claim is "no *trusted* keeper" rather than "no keeper".

## What the evidence folder is for

Every number in this README is reproducible from recorded output, not from a model:

| File | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `probe-2026-08-26.txt` | live markets, six tiers, the flat 2.9% spread |
| `calibration-2026-08-26.md` | 2,422 settled markets and the maker/taker arithmetic |
| `live-quote-2026-08-26.md` | the working quote, and the calldata diff that found the price-scale bug |
| `first-fill-2026-08-26.md` | both legs filled, and what the position is actually worth |
| `reactivity-spike-2026-08-26.md` | a full day of wrong hypotheses, and the resolution |

Four of our assumptions were killed by running things rather than reading about them:
5-minute windows (there are six tiers), parity arbitrage (impossible — one book),
the reactivity callback path (closed), and the price scale (collateral decimals, not
1e18). None of those were visible from the documentation.

[`docs/SDK-FEEDBACK.md`](docs/SDK-FEEDBACK.md) reports each of them back to the DreamDEX
team, with reproduction steps.
